# logs

This folder contains the logs of the model runs.

Currently, the `config.json` file is used to store the configuration of the model.
After running themode `logits.csv` file is created here which contains the predictions of the model.
Note that in this folder the model weights have to be stored as `model_1.pth` to `model_5.pth` for the five models of the ensemble. The model weights are available upon request.
